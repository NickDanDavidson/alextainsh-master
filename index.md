  heading: A Bit About Alex
  lead_in: >-
    Hi, I'm Alex. I am a sports marketer with over 10 years of experience
    promoting, branding, and presenting live events. A native of Rhode Island
    and one of three boys, sports have always been a part of my life. But it was
    my childhood love of Ken Griffey, Jr., and Tom Brady that made me a lifelong
    fan. After graduating from the George Washington University, I spent a few
    years in Albuquerque, New Mexico, working for the Triple-A Albuquerque
    Isotopes and enjoying the incredible landscapes before settling in beautiful
    Chattanooga, Tennessee. For the last 7 years, as the Marketing Manager and
    Emcee for the Chattanooga Lookouts, I have brought the Lookouts brand to
    life and created an entertaining, memory-making experience every night at
    the ballpark. Fun fact—Star Wars Night is always my favorite game of the
    year. It’s just super fun.


    Life in the minors has allowed me to develop a broad range of skills, including game presentation, graphic design and photography, social media marketing, and partner fulfillment. I understand how all these things work together to create a team's overall identity. Chattanooga has been the perfect place to grow, and it’s been awesome becoming a member of this community. I love to be active and am a life-long runner who recently discovered that long distances are actually more fun. I have now completed three half marathons, and hopefully soon I can update this to include "and one marathon." If you are at a Lookouts game or checking out the Chattanooga Miracle League, be sure to say “Hi.”
